I am a professor at the Federal University of Amapá in the Department of Physics. I am PhD in Biotechnology from Rede Bionorte, Amapá, Brazil. I work with physics applied to the biomedical area, with researches involving theoretical and experimental treatment, computer simulations and data analysis, where I already use mainly R and Python languages (the latter a short time).
